# Email or SMS Spam Detection System - Capstone Project

## About Dataset
The dataset used for this project involves SMS messages that are labeled as either spam or ham (non-spam). The objective is to build a model that can accurately classify SMS messages into these two categories.

### Data Description
The dataset consists of SMS messages with two columns:

| Column       | Description                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `label`      | The classification of the message (spam or ham) |
| `message`    | The content of the SMS message           |

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect whether an SMS message is spam or ham. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following:

1. Preprocess the SMS messages to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
2. Train a classification model on the preprocessed data.
3. Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
4. Implement the model to predict the label of new SMS messages.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **nltk**: For natural language processing tasks.

## Approach
1. **Data Import**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove any unnecessary characters, stop words, and perform stemming or lemmatization.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.
4. **Model Training**: Train a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) on the extracted features.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the label of new SMS messages.
